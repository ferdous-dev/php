## Loops in PHP 
```php
<?php
// Sequential Control
echo "Hello";
echo " World";

// Selection Control
$x = 10;
if ($x > 5) {
    echo "x is greater than 5";
} else {
    echo "x is less than or equal to 5";
}

// Repetition Control
// for loop
for ($i = 0; $i < 5; $i++) {
    echo $i;
}

// while loop
$count = 0;
while ($count < 5) {
    echo $count;
    $count++;
}

// do-while loop
$count = 0;
do {
    echo $count;
    $count++;
} while ($count < 5);

//
$fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"];

foreach ($fruits as $fruit) {
    echo $fruit . " ";
}
// Output: apple banana cherry

$person = ["name" => "John", "age" => 30, "city" => "New York"];

foreach ($person as $key => $value) {
    echo "$key: $value ";
}
// Output: name: John age: 30 city: New York 
?>
```
### Explanation:

1. **Sequential Control**:
    
    - `echo "Hello";` and `echo " World";` are executed one after the other.
2. **Selection Control**:
    
    - `if` statement checks if `$x` is greater than 5 and prints the corresponding message.
3. **Repetition Control**:
    
    - **for loop**: Executes the block of code 5 times, printing values from 0 to 4.
    - **while loop**: Executes the block of code while `$count` is less than 5, printing values from 0 to 4.
    - **do-while loop**: Similar to the `while` loop, but it guarantees the block of code will be executed at least once.
    - **foreach loop**: the `foreach` runs through each element in an array:

These examples cover the basics of control structures in PHP, demonstrating how to manage the flow of control within a program.
