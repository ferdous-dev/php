PHP 5 introduced exception handling with `try`, `catch`, and `throw` blocks. This allows you to handle errors in a more structured way.

```php
try {
    // Code that may throw an exception
    if (!file_exists("somefile.txt")) {
        throw new Exception("File not found.");
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    echo "Caught exception: " . $e->getMessage();
} finally {
    echo "This block is always executed.";
}
```
